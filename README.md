# bookstoreGPT
a chatbot for a bookstore made as a final project for BrainStation
this project is an ai chatbot which is prompted through the chatbot-prompt.ts and book-data.ts files, which are located in:
src/app/helpers/constants
these files give the ai chatbot its "parameters" for helping within an imaginary bookstore, as modeled by the placeholder "website content" in the bcakground of the chat.
the chatbot is programmed to be able to help with the book data provided by the links associated with book-data.ts.
